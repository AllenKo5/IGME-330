        <p id="abouttext">
            I've always been interested in video games, which has led to an interest in game balance and level
            design. As a Game Design & Development major at Rochester Institute of Technology, I have been slowly
            building experience in programming languages and game engines so I can better understand the kind of work
            that goes into making video games. I have knowledge in C#, C++, and Java, as well as HTML/CSS/JavaScript and
            minimal knowledge of
            Python. Additionally, in terms of game engines, I have experience in Unity and Unreal.

                    <p>
                        The EDH Commander Finder is a Web application that uses the Scryfall API, an API for Magic:
                        The Gathering. The application allows you to set parameters such as name, colors, and mana cost,
                        and returns the possible commanders that fulfill those requirements. Each image is a clickable
                        link that leads to that card's Scryfall entry. The program uses Web storage to remember the last
                        name you inputted. I designed the entire page and wrote the JavaScript for a class assignment,
                        but it was also something that I wanted to be able to use myself, since I play the game. This
                        was
                        the first time I had done something with an API, so figuring out what search terms I wanted was
                        one of the biggest challenges for this project.

                    <p>
                        Robo Runner is a Web game that uses PixiJS, a WebGL renderer. The object of the game is to
                        get the highest score you can by avoiding the obstacles that come your way. In between attempts,
                        you can upgrade various stats that will give you more flexibility in achieving a greater score.
                        The project uses PixiJS to render text and sprites, and uses howler.js for in-game sounds. I was
                        responsible for both game logic as well as the sprites as part of a class project. I was
                        able to utilize the various skills from programming in other languages to make the game function
                        on
                        the Web.

                    <p>
                        The Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Finder utilizes the YGOPRODeck API to access card details from a
                        database. The application allows you to set parameters such as the card name and stats, then
                        searches
                        the API for the cards and displays their cards. The program uses local storage to save the
                        previous parameters and state. Additionally, the application uses Firebase for a community tab
                        where
                        you can see what cards other people have favorited. Now that I have more experience, this is a
                        work
                        that I'm a lot more satisfied with.
